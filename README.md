### 🛡️ susceptibility-agent
Agentic system to **avoid detection**. Analyzes radar/EW emissions and recommends stealth mode when threats are detected.

**Agents**: Signal Intelligence → Threat Assessment → EW Advisor

### ⚔️ vulnerability-agent
Agentic system to **respond to attacks**. Detects jamming/interference and executes countermeasures (ECM, evasion, neutralization).

**Agents**: Cybersecurity → EW Classifier → Response Coordinator → ECM Executor

### 🔧 recovery-agent
Agentic system for **post-impact recovery**. Diagnoses failures, prioritizes critical systems, and restores operational capabilities.

**Agents**: Diagnostics → AI Prioritizer → Communications Router → Maintenance Automation
