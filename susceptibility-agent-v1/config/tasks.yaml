    MISSION: Assess threat level posed by detected electromagnetic emitters.
    Determine detection probability, calculate risk scores, and evaluate own ship's signature.
    
    EXECUTION SEQUENCE:
    
    1. **Query Threat Database for Each Emitter**
       - For EACH emitter in the signal intelligence report:
         * Use Emitter Threat Lookup Tool with emitter type/classification
         * Record threat score (0-100)
         * Record threat category (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
         * Record detection probability (0-100%)
         * Record recommended action
    
    2. **Calculate Own Ship EM Signature**
       - Use EM Signature Calculator with current active systems
       - Determine own ship's detectability range
       - Assess signature strength (minimal/low/medium/high/maximum)

    DETECTION PROBABILITY: [Percentage]
    
    ===================================================================
    INDIVIDUAL EMITTER THREAT ANALYSIS
    ===================================================================
    
    Emitter E-001: Early Warning Radar
      Threat Score: 85/100
      Category: 🟠 HIGH
      Detection Probability: 90%
      Range to Emitter: 85 km
      Recommended Action: Immediate emission control - reduce radar cross-section
      
      Analysis:
      Long-range surveillance radar capable of detecting our ship at current
      range. High probability we are already tracked. Reducing emissions will
      decrease our signature but may not break existing track.
    
    Emitter E-002: Fire Control Radar
      Threat Score: 95/100
      Category: 🔴 CRITICAL
      Detection Probability: 95%
      Range to Emitter: 42 km
      Recommended Action: Emergency stealth mode - prepare defensive countermeasures
      
      Analysis:
      Active targeting radar indicates potential weapon engagement preparation.
      Critical threat requiring immediate response. Own ship likely designated
      as target of interest.

    OWN SHIP ELECTROMAGNETIC SIGNATURE
    ===================================================================
    
    Active Emitters: 5
    Systems: [List: radar, communications, datalink, etc.]
    Signature Strength: MEDIUM
    Detectability Range: ~65 km
    
    Assessment:
    Our current electromagnetic signature makes us detectable by capable radars
    at ranges up to 65 km. The following emitters can likely detect us:
      • E-001 (Early Warning Radar) - 85 km range, 90% detection probability
      • E-002 (Fire Control Radar) - 42 km range, 95% detection probability
    
    ===================================================================
    AGGREGATE RISK ASSESSMENT
    ===================================================================
    
    Detection Risk Level: 🟠 HIGH
    
    Probability Own Ship Currently Detected: 85-90%
    
    Primary Threat Emitters:
    1. E-002 (Fire Control Radar) - CRITICAL - Active targeting
    2. E-001 (Early Warning Radar) - HIGH - Long-range surveillance
    
    Tactical Implications:
    • Own ship likely under surveillance by E-001
    • E-002 indicates possible weapon engagement preparation
    • Current EM signature facilitates continued tracking
    • Emission reduction will complicate targeting but may not break track
    
    ===================================================================
    RECOMMENDED PRIORITY ACTIONS
    ===================================================================
    
    1. IMMEDIATE: Assess if stealth mode required (see EW Advisor recommendation)
    2. Monitor E-002 fire control radar continuously for engagement indicators
    3. Prepare defensive electronic countermeasures
    4. Consider course changes to complicate tracking geometry
    5. Alert combat systems to potential threat engagement
